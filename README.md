CS 490 Exam Taker
Description - As a professor create questions and exams, then after student takes exams, professor can review and score them. As a student you can take exams and review once professor grades it. This application is a 3-tier web application comprised of a front-end, middle-end, and back-end. I took the front-end part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), while my team members took on the middle-end (PHP) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). The idea is once the questions are added to the question bank, the database holds them and waits for them to be added onto a newly created exam. Then the exam is stored for students to take. Once the student takes the exam, it's stored in the database with results. The middle-end requests relevant data from the back-end and the autograder kicks in, checking the results and giving basic scores and comments indicative of how good or poor the results are. After the autograder completes its job the results are sent back to the database to be stored. Awaiting the professor's request to check the results and manually grade and review the taken exam for accuracy. Once the professor is finished the reviewed exam is submitted back to the database and released for the student to check the results!
